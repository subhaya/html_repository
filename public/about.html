<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Since graduating with Bachelors degree in Mechatronics Systems Engineering from Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences, Germany in 2018, I have garnered a substantial experience in Python programming through my work at Magazino- A Jungheinrich Company, Munich as a Robotic software engineer. My job encompassed a wide scope of software programming with Python for automated industry solutions including feature development, software integration and optimization of robot performance. Within my capacity, I lead several deployment projects on-site for industry leaders such as Zalando and Eobuwie ensuring highest software functionality and efficient product handover. This involved consistent collaboration across multidisciplinary teams such as the Operations, Sales, Hardware department and customer sites.</p>

<p>Prior to this, I worked as a research and student assistant at Fraunhofer Institute IPA, Stuttgart developing mobile robot navigation and ultrasonic positioning systems. My tasks included but not limited to hardware design, software development in Python and ROS as well as performing system tests and accuracy analysis. Beyond the lab, I was also engaged with experts and customers of the organization which allowed me to process and integrate innovative digital solutions aligning with customerâ€™s perspectives.</p>

<p>Over the course of my career, I have grown a close affinity towards creating seamless software experience for people to achieve their goals regardless of their industries. As a learner, I am an adept follower of prospective developments within AI and technology and look forward to leverage my programming skills into meaningful projects as yours.  </p>
